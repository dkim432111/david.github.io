<p>We have reason to believe that our appliances may be secretly collecting and selling our data.</p>

<p> Do you ever wonder why our appliances need connection to a separate device, or even access to the internet to gain full functionality?

<p>Just recently, an individual claimed that they saw personalised adverts based on conversations they had in their own home. This is not new, but, they claimed that the advert had specific information about their dietary preferences. 
    </p>


<p>They looked into it further, and posted a clause in the terms and conditions of their toaster.

<p>Other users found similar clauses in other appliances, and widely were unaware that they ‘opted in’ to their everyday preferences being archived and sold. Legal experts say that you are always provided an opportunity to opt out afterwards, but state that these companies are legally allowed to make it difficult to do so. </p>
