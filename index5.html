<p>In the spirit of the newly announced ‘renewed’ book service, that is, a book that has been updated artificially to adhere to our modern day standards, we have decided to make a piece reflecting on the unique process.</p>

<p> Mainly used as a translator, it was implemented by historians to properly recount dated texts in their plain and ordinary meaning by updating the vocabulary and references using AI. <br><br> Now the company, Renewal, has announced that they will start ‘renewing’, or adapting popular novels, with their first being Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet.

<p>Of course, there is an immediate concern of jeopardising the ‘integrity’ of the original text, as its context, and specific temporal features are critical parts of the text’s identity. But, the company stated, that the original texts will always be available, that they are merely renewing it for a new younger audience to appreciate.
    </p>

<p>The public's reception has been mixed, reflecting the two stances described above.</p>

<p>Expanding on this concept, scientists in the US are exploring the potential applications of Inyeon’s Red Thread to accurately recreat past events from outdated texts. The US Centre of History and Paleontology claims that such technology may be able to infer accurately, significant gaps in our history that may be too difficult for an individual to properly assess and understand. 
</p>

<p>As the technology is only now seeing practical deployment in Inyeon’s public service, it will likely take a few years to appropriately use it for these purposes.</p>
