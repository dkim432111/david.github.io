<!--This Article is a stripped down version I manually tweaked, ideally it should work alright on most devices as I made sure images, video sizes, matched the text %, and removed any px or any other value for sizing. I spent a bit of time making sure the content adapted to different device width's so I hope that holds up. Anything I used is referenced, and I looked at tutorials per problem, rather than use a template and modify it, the closest template I used was our class weekly activities.-->

<p> Earlier this year, I made a commentary piece about Inyeon’s controversial service, and I was sceptical about its use case. But I’ve spent the last week testing it, and I’ll be honest, it did surprise me. <a href="inyeon.html">See here for Inyeon's website.</a> 
<br>

<p>My viewers have likely seen my late Grandmother’s artwork in my articles. I recollect a poorly written poem I wrote to her back in 2055, when I first joined the Archivist. But since then, I moved away from my creative aspirations as a poet and focused on this column, emerging tech commentary. </p>
</p>

<p>AI-generated work under the guise of a human author was gaining more traction than any ‘authentic’ poets, so I was naturally discouraged. <a href="index3.html">See here for an article covering this.</a> But I did find a new interest, exploring what these technologies might mean for us.</p>

<p>Now, I tell you a bit of my past, because I want you to think about what value it brings; artistic, societal, or otherwise. If an AI combed through public archives, it could probably tell you everything I told you now, even with my tonality if prompted. So, I ask you, does that have less inherent value than my actual recollection? 
</p>

<p>It’s a difficult question, and seemingly our tendency to answer “Yes!” blindly has shifted over the years. People now do not believe that there may be a difference, and that anything ‘authentic’, that is, not generated by AI, is only more valuable if we can discern the difference. Then, we get into a whole area of philosophical and metaphysical questions about a human’s relative worth to an AI. </p>

<b>- Is artistry 'inherently' human? -</b>

<p>One could argue that as we made AI, the database it uses, that its art is 'human' as a mere extension of us.</p>

<p>I can see how this is an acceptable claim, and it is a sound premise. But I think this way of seeing art as only valid based on the 'humanness' of it invites ambguity. What is "humanness"? And why should we care?</p>

<p>I for one, agree with many scholars in which they ascribe the labour, effort, and originality created in that process to 'humanise' art. Art is not valuable because of its quality, everyone can look at the same painting, and ascribe it a different worth. Art is valuable as a process, and expression of a human or collective's inherent worth. </p>

<b>- The inherent value of a life -</b>

<p>This argument relies on your acceptance that every life has an inherent value. If you can't agree with this, or follow an alternative to Dworkin's theory, then it becomes problematic. </p>

<p>This area of philosophy is long-standing, and we can't even begin to properly debate that here, nor can i invalidate other philosophies. But when I see the progression of AI in creating beautiful artwork, literature, media, and music, over the last few decades, I wish we could have had this discussion earlier.</p>

<p>In the past, AI could not generate such complex and nuanced pieces of art, and many thought it would never get to that point. Some critics said that it only recycles our work, so it never would create anything original. But I can't agree, we ourselves recycle our experiences, once AI has access to the entirety of our collective experiences, it might surpass anything we make in quality, and make it faster as well.</p>

<p>But here, I want to say that it should not be a race or a competition. Artists failed to collaborate with AI, so it became a competitor (of course they are not entirely to blame).</p>

<p>I look at my Grandmother's art, and I don't value it because it looks pretty, or was created with such a labourous method. I love it because she made it.</p>

<b>- A circular logic -</b>

<p>Now this thought isn't exactly a rational one. It invites the obvious critique, "So if it were exactly the same, but made by AI, you would not love it?". Even so, if I did not know, does that lower its inherent value? Or was my experience all that art needs to be validated?</p>

<p>It all goes back to the question we have struggled to answer, "What is art?" When I listen to Beethoven's sonets, and claude-AI's classical pieces, why would I value one over the other? </p>

<p>I believe that the story and process behind the art gives it value. If not? Why does a parent love their child's poorly scribbled drawings, if not for the mere fact that it is a labour of love from a life that only yet encompasses them?</p>

<p>I said before that AI can, and currently does surpass our art in many ways. But before it did, we had an opportunity. When photographs became possible, artists struggled, how do you beat an exact image of the place, time, and experience? But they innovated, adapted. I think somewhere along the way, we saw AI, and lost sight of what we could've done to work with it, and make sure our creativity would still thrive.</p>

<b>- The path not the end -</b>

<p>So I just wish decades ago, when AI was still emerging, we could have had more of these discussions. We create meaning, and once we lose sight of it, amid consumerism, politics, and convenience, we forget. I'm not saying that we can't feel emotions from AI-generated pieces of art, I'm saying that art extends far pass the end result, and I wish we could've criticised and distinguished what makes a product and what makes art. 
</p>

<p>Art is not created to be sold. It is created to be created, it is a process in reality that is only appreciated by us. A replication of a message, a experience, regardless of its accuracy or believability is pointless. </p>

<!--Article content2-->
<p>This brings me back to the main catalyst behind my article, Inyeon's Red Thread. The service used my Grandmother's pictures, videos, data, to recreate a day where she went on a hike with her friends. When I saw it I was moved, and suprised by the capability of AI to create such a work. But I soon considered what pieces of art I have seen in recent years, and rarely it was made by a human. Everything I  just criticised I am complicit in. I did what I previously just said we shouldn't have done, I just accepted it and stopped. I loved poetry, yet, I could not see what value it offered me and others past the end result.</p>

<p>I am reluctant to share the memory the service has generated, but I wanted to give you all a chance to experience what the Red Thread can offer. I want you to have doubts, think about it, criticise it, appreciate it, be moved by it, so you can answer the first question I posed for yourself. And I hope my next piece will be not an article but a poem. </p>

<!--W3 Schools "The HTML <video> Element" / "HTML Youtube videos"
    Additional note about my process for this:
    I went on a hike to the blue mountains with some friends and took photos but also videos in the same moments. I got an online depth map generator for 2d photos, and put it in blender alongside the original photo. Tutorials took a bit of time. 
    In the video, I took the rendered clips, put them in premiere and took the audio from the videos I recorded and sampled a few key moments. You can hear some laughter, and talking, and atmos, foley, etc, from the actual day. I supplemented it with freesounds for layering so it wouldn't feel empty, if you listen past the music there are quite a few sounds at a given moment that match the video. If you go through a waterfall, water droplets, a bush, leaves rustling, etc. It is as accurate as I could to what I recorded and heard on the day.
    And the music is royalty free, licence code at the yt video description.
    I wanted to give an impression of walking through the memories, and I tried to do that mainly through audio. And, ideally it was to give an impression of the memories forming inconsistently, some you see clearly "that's a tree, waterfall, etc", some its very iffy.
    The beginning text crawl was not initially there, but a lot of people were confused about what they were seeing when I showed them, so I inserted a short text opening, but I removed a lot of fluff, because I did not want to detract from my main concept. Last thing, the text crawl is inspired from the opening of the new Superman movie. Hope you enjoyed!
