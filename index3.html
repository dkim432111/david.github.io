<p>The IBS has issued the 2068 Readiness Scale, a scale that depicts AI's suitability and coverage of specific industries and professions.</p>

<p>We can see the scale has gradually changed since IBS's first report published nearly over a decade ago. It seems that creatives; which include painters, musicians, filmmakers, are at the most risk. With a significant increase in AI-Generated creative work a likely contributing factor.</p>
</p>

<p>Other positions; service industry roles, software engineers, have seen a similar decline, with most companies only adhering to the statutory mandates for a minimum number of human-filled positions.</p>

<p>However, arts, culture, and entertainment do not fall within the recognised categories for these government subsidies. So, we are noticing a seemingly repititive output of media, with many noticing a lack of any memorable works.</p>

<p>According to reports from Forbes, and the WEF, AI has already surpassed the required threshold to be deemed a 'fit and proper worker'. This means, that AI will be treated as a 'pseudo' human under law, similar to companies per the Corporation Act.</p>

<p>Although there is a substantial amount of information on the subject, it is still an ever-shifting process in the workplace between workers and AI. AI as a tool, coworker, and competitor are not firm roles, and may vary industry to industry. But what we see, is that as people become more accustomed to AI in their workplace, there is a tendancy to either over-rely or be overly adverse to it.</p>

<p>It seems that where people have adapted to AI in their workplace, moderated their usage, and changed their workflow around it, AI was actually used less. And so, these areas have been the industries with the highest human-filled workplaces.</p>

<p>And the perceived job displacement has been significantly lower in these workplaces as well. Mainly, we see this in architecture, where despite AI being able to create floorplans and blueprints from scratch, it has not diminished the human's role in this position.</p>

<p>Instead of being combative, many firms used it to generate initial concepts of client's instructions, and once they agreed, a human took over, and consulted with the client.</p>

<p>It seems that firms, companies, and industires that segmented AI-usage, and familiarised employees with AI and ensured adequate training and retention, are the most preserved professions.</p>
